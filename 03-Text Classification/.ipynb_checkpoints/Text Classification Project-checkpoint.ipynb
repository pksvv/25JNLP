      "Pandas(Index=3, label='pos', review='according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \\r\\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \\r\\non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \\r\\nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \\r\\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \\r\\ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \\r\\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\\'s fascist regime . \\r\\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\\'t like federico fellini\\'s work very much . \\r\\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \\r\\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \\r\\nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \\r\\nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \\r\\nfellini\\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \\r\\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \\r\\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \\r\\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\\' visions . \\r\\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \\r\\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \\r\\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \\r\\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\\'t care that much about politics . \\r\\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \\r\\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \\r\\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \\r\\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \\r\\nfellini couldn\\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \\r\\nvignettes aren\\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\\'s fantasies . \\r\\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \\r\\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \\r\\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \\r\\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\\'s long-time associate nino rota . \\r\\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \\r\\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \\r\\n')\n",
